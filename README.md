Hello!

This is my first program. This is a nutrition calculator.
In this work I have used a open food database from Estonian Health Institute (Eesti Tervise Arengu Instituut).
Some Dietary Reference Values(DRV) are also taken frome there. The others are from Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012.

This program is not yet final.

Have a nice day.
